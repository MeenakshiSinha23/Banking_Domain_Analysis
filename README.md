## ⚙️ Setup Instructions

### ✅ Step 1: Set up MySQL database

1. Open **MySQL Workbench**.
2. Run the following:

```sql
CREATE DATABASE banking_case;
USE banking_case;

-- Import or create tables such as customer, transactions, etc.
SHOW TABLES;
SELECT * FROM customer;
```

> 💡 Use `localhost:3306` with `root` as the default user.

---

### ✅ Step 2: Python Environment

Install the necessary libraries using pip:

```bash
pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn mysql-connector-python
```

---

### ✅ Step 3: Power BI

1. Open `banking_case_dashboard.pbix` in Power BI Desktop.
2. Connect to MySQL:

   * **Server**: `localhost:3306`
   * **Database**: `banking_case`
   * Authentication: `root` + password
3. If you get encryption errors, click **Advanced** and set:

   ```
   TrustServerCertificate=True
   ```
